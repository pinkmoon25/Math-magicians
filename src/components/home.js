        <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>Mathematics</u></a></strong>
        {' '}
        is a subject of numbers, shapes, data,
        measurements and also logical activities.
        It has a huge scope in every field of our life,
        such as medicine, engineering, finance, natural science, economics, etc.
        We are all surrounded by a mathematical world.
        Mathematics is a subject of logic.

        Mathematics is a historical subject.
        It has been explored by various mathematicians across the world since centuries,
        in different civilizations.

        <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>Archimedes</u></a></em></strong>
        ,
        from the BC century is known to be the Father of Mathematics.
        He introduced formulas to calculate surface area and volume of solids.
        Whereas,

        , born in 476 CE, is known as the Father of Indian Mathematics.
        In the 6th century BC, the study of mathematics began with the Pythagoreans,
        as a “demonstrative discipline”.
        The word mathematics originated from the Greek word “
        <u>mathema</u>
        ”,
        which means “subject of instruction”.
        Another mathematician, named

        <strong><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><u>Euclid</u></a></em></strong>
        , introduced the axiom, postulates, theorems and proofs,
        which are also used in today&apos;s mathematics

      <h3>Branches of Mathematics</h3>
      <p>The main branches of mathematics are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Number System</li>
        <li>Algebra </li>
        <li>Geometry</li>
        <li>Calculus</li>
        <li>Topology</li>
        <li>Trigonometry</li>
        <li>Probability</li>
        <li>and Statistics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These mathematical concepts fall under pure mathematics.
        These form the base of mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applied mathematics is another form, where mathematicians,
        scientists or technicians use mathematical concepts to solve practical problems.
        It describes the professional use of mathematics.
